## Instructions

How to run each project.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install and how to install them.

1. Flutter SDK - [installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install);
2. Your favorite IDE (Intellij, Android Studio, others) or Code Editor;
3. An Android/iOS Device or Emulator.

### Next Step
Download the source code.

### Running

1. Open the [main.dart](https://github.com/nicovlad16/google-flutter-projects/blob/master/lib/main.dart) file
2. Modify the import with the name of the directory of the project you want to run

**Example**
```dart
import 'movies_redux/main.dart' as app;

void main() {
  app.main();
}
```
3. Run the app - in the command-line
```shell
flutter run lib/main.dart
```


## Coding Style

This project uses [static analysis](https://github.com/nicovlad16/google-flutter-projects/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml) together with [Github Actions](https://github.com/nicovlad16/google-flutter-projects/actions). 

This helps in bug-prevention and ensures that the code conforms with the Flutter and Dart style guidelines.
